Calculus Module
📚 Overview

Implementing calculus concepts from first principles in Python. Building a numerical computing foundation for machine learning and scientific computing.

📁 Current Implementation

derivative.py

· Static polynomial differentiator: Computes derivatives of polynomial functions using power rule

integration.py (coming soon)

· Riemann sums: Left, right, and midpoint approximations
· Numerical integration: Trapezoidal and Simpson's rules


🤖 ML Applications

.still need to learn more about future math subjects
🎯 Why I Built This

Combining my passion for mathematics with programming to build understanding from the ground up. This library serves as both a learning tool and a foundation for future ML projects.


# Algorithms & Data Structures

This module contains foundational data structures and algorithm implementations built from scratch as part of my journey toward developing AI/ML systems at a low level.

The goal is not just usage, but deep understanding of how core computational structures work internally.

## 📦 Current Implementations

### 🔗 Linked List (Custom Implementation)

A fully implemented singly linked list built from scratch using OOP principles.

Features:

* Node abstraction (`data`, `next`)
* Dynamic append operation
* Manual pointer traversal
* Clean separation between `Node` and `LinkedList`
* Explicit reference management (no built-in Python list usage)

Purpose:

* Understand memory references
* Practice pointer-style traversal
* Strengthen algorithmic reasoning
* Prepare for tree and graph structures

## 🧠 Why This Matters for ML/AI

Data structures are the backbone of:

* Graph-based models
* Optimization algorithms
* Computational graph engines
* Custom tensor operations
* Memory-efficient pipelines

Building them manually improves:

* Time complexity intuition
* Memory model understanding
* Structural thinking

## 🛠 Design Philosophy

* Implement from scratch (no shortcuts)
* Focus on clarity over micro-optimization
* Prioritize learning and correctness
* Build reusable foundations for future ML modules

🎓 Why This Exists

As a computer science student targeting AI/ML research, I believe true mastery comes from implementing foundational concepts rather than just using libraries. This repository serves as:

1. Learning documentation — translating mathematical theory into code
2. Portfolio foundation — demonstrating depth over breadth
3. Future reference — a codebase to build upon for advanced projects
4. Educational resource — for others following a similar path
